Which are then rated upon their severity.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n\n* The nerve can only be rated under ***ONE*** category **OR** however it affects range of motion (ROM). Whichever will give the Veteran the highest rating.\n* If the Veteran has a [Musculoskeletal](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/MS) issue that can be attributed to the limitation of ROM. Then the Veteran *CAN* get an individual rating for the nerve and the ROM!\n* There are a *pair* of nerves (each controlling a side of the body). As such, the veteran **CAN** get an individual rating for each nerve affected! As such, the nerves **ARE** eligible for [Bilateral factor](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteranBenefits/w/vamath/#wiki_bilateral_factor).\n* Nerves like waterways can split and branch out into other nerves. If a damaged nerve affects other nerves that later split off from it. The Veteran will only get **ONE** rating for the original damaged nerve! Those split off nerves cannot get their own ratings. Yes, kinda silly but - VA.\n\n\n\t+ An example of this would be the sciatic nerve. Which branches out into other nerves such as the tibial and peroneal nerves. If the sciatic nerve was damaged above those nerve branches that served those 2 nerves. Those nerves could **NOT** be rated.\n\n\nParalysis\n---------\n\n\nInability to control or sense.\n\n\n* Incomplete (Mild) - Feelings of tingling or mild pain. Some mild ROM impacts.\n* Incomplete (Moderate) - Feelings of tingling, numbness, moderate pain, or other symptoms that do interfere with ability to function.\n* Incomplete (Severe) - Ability to function is seriously limited. Symptoms might include things like poor blood circulation and loss of muscle mass.\n* Complete - No sensation or control, basically it is gone.\n\n\nNeuritis\n--------\n\n\nPain or numbness without nerve degeneration or objective signs of nerve dysfunction (the doctor seeing/finding it).\n\n\n* Mild - Loss of sensation, loss of muscle mass, or loss of reflexes. The total impact does not significantly impacts ability to function.\n* Moderate - Loss of sensation, loss of muscle mass, or loss of reflexes. The total impact significantly impacts ability to function.\n* Severe - Loss of sensation, loss of muscle mass, and loss of reflexes. The total impact seriously impacts ability to function.\n\n\nNeuralgia\n---------\n\n\nStabbing, burning, and often severe pain due to an irritated or damaged nerve. \n\n\n* Mild - Tingling or mild pain.

Looking at the chart, note each of the eight lines and the points at which the vision 'ring' touches each of the directional lines.\n\n\n#### Left Eye\n\n\n\n\n| Direction | Point of Intersection (\u00b0) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Temporally | 30 |\n| Down temporally | 30 |\n| Down | 20 |\n| Down nasally | 20 |\n| Nasally | 20 |\n| Up nasally | 20 |\n| Up | 20 |\n| Up temporally | 20 |\n\n\nNow we all everything up 30 + 30 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 180.\n\n\nGreat! Now we need to get the average impairment so, divide 180 by 8.\n\n\n180/8 = 22.5\n\n\nOur Veteran here has an concentric contraction of 22.5\u00b0 in their left eye.\n\n\n#### Right Eye\n\n\n![](//b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/G-qlzAY3dptVqVyl1dl0YEws3Fev7XIxeGOo4ps0gcM.png)\n\n\nAgain, repeat the process but this time for the right eye.\n\n\n\n\n| Direction | Point of Intersection (\u00b0) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Temporally | 85 |\n| Down temporally | 80 |\n| Down | 60 |\n| Down nasally | 55 |\n| Nasally | 60 |\n| Up nasally | 55 |\n| Up | 45 |\n| Up temporally | 60 |\n\n\nYou should have gotten an average concentric contraction of 62.5\u00b0.\n\n\nTechnically, their right eye has *no* impairment as it has the a total field of vision of 500\u00b0. But I hope it reinforced the concept for you in any event.\n\n\nNow onto the ratings!\n\n\n### Ratings for Impairment of Visual Field\n\n\nThe Veteran can get a rating based upon **ONE** of the following:\n\n\n#### Scotoma\n\n\nCondition in which there are blind spots within the visual field with areas around them that are normal.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\n\n* Veteran can get separate ratings, one for each eye if applicable.\n\n\n\n\n| Rating | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| 10% | **MINIMUM** rating if 1/4th of visual field is affected **OR** the blind spots are located within the 30\u00b0 circle. |\n\n\nIf the Veteran would get a higher rating based upon their [Average concentric contraction](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/eyes/#wiki_calculating_impairment_of_visual_field_.28average_concentric_contraction.29) it will be rated under that schedule instead.\n\n\n", "rating": {"10%": "**MINIMUM** rating if 1/4th of visual field is affected **OR** the blind spots are located within the 30\u00b0 circle."}}, {"id": "https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/eyes/#wiki_muscle_dysfunction_aka_double_vision_.28diplopia.29", "area": "eyes", "title": "Muscle Dysfunction AKA Double Vision (Diplopia)", "content": "\nWhen your eye muscles can't properly track and focus on objects.

However, the key parts are the 4 quadrants (up, temporally, down, and nasally) and the semi circles within them.\n\n\nThe colors correspond to values in the below table:\n\n\n### Table for Assigning Visual Acuity for Muscle Dysfunction\n\n\n\n\n| Color | Assigned Visual Acuity |\n| --- | --- |\n| Green | 20/40. |\n| Blue | 20/70. |\n| Purple | 20/100. |\n| Yellow | 20/200. |\n| Orange | 15/200. |\n| Red | 5/200. |\n\n\nNow lets move on to an example!\n\n\n### Calculating Muscle Dysfunction\n\n\nCalculating things really is not that bad. In short, it does **NOT** matter how much of an area is covered. What matters is the greatest area of impact as determined by the the [Color table](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/eyes/#wiki_table_for_assigning_visual_acuity_for_muscle_dysfunction).\n\n\nBelow is an example of a completed test:\n\n\n![](//b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/pmKbkI78dc6lfnM-OqByE7Xn8YsNaYk68aSPYIcJM_c.png)\n\n\nThe grey areas demonstrate areas in which the Veteran has double vision.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n\n* If there are two or more separate separate islands of double vision the assigned visual acuity will be **INCREASED** by one level (e.g. 20/100 to 20/200).\n* Only **ONE** eye can be rated for muscle dysfunction, so whichever one is worse. We will come back to this later.\n\n\n### Left Eye\n\n\nWhile a lot of area is covered, the only colors covered are green and blue. \n\n\nLooking at the [Color table](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/eyes/#wiki_table_for_assigning_visual_acuity_for_muscle_dysfunction) we see that this eye would be assigned a visual acuity of *20/70*.\n\n\n### Right Eye\n\n\nThis eye has two islands of dysfunction:\n\n\n* The top island - covers green, blue, and yellow. Again, the [Color table](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/eyes/#wiki_table_for_assigning_visual_acuity_for_muscle_dysfunction) tells us that that yellow is the most impactful, so the assigned visual acuity would be *20/200*.\n* The bottom island - covers green and blue. So the worst impact from this island is *20/70*.\n\n\nSo the right eye gets an assigned visual acuity of *20/200*, right?\n\n\nWait! Remember the important note? \n\n\nSince there are islands involved, we need to bump that up that 20/200 to 15/200!\n\n\nSo that means our right eye will end up with an assigned visual acuity of *15/200*. Since the VA only allows one rating for muscular dysfunction. Only the Veteran's right eye would get the special treatment while their left eye defaults to it's normal corrected vision.\n\n\n### Ratings for Muscle Dysfunction\n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n\n* If double vision comes and goes **OR** is correctable with spectacles a **0%** rating is assigned.\n* **The following ratings are for ONLY for those with just muscle dysfunction(s).**\n\n\n\t+ If the Veteran has **BOTH** a muscle dysfunction *and* a [Central visual acuity issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/eyes/#wiki_muscle_dysfunction_and_central_visual_acuity), **OR** a [Field of vision issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/eyes/#wiki_muscle_dysfunction_and_visual_field), **OR** [All the above](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/eyes/#wiki_muscle_dysfunction.2C_central_visual_acuity.2C_and_visual_field). **IN EITHER OR BOTH EYES** They are instead rated on those linked schedules.\n* Remember, only one eye can be rated for muscle dysfunction. The other eye will **NOT** be assigned a visual acuity **AND** will **NOT** be considered to have a muscle dysfunction for rating purposes.\n* If only one eye is service connected. The other eye is assigned a visual acuity of 20/40.\n\n\n\n\n| Muscle Dysfunction Assigned Visual Acuity \u2192 | 20/40 | 20/50 | 20/70 | 20/100 | 20/200 | 15/200 | 10/200 | 5/200 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Other Eye \u2193 |  |\n| 20/40 | 0% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 20% | 20% | 30% | 30% |\n\n\nUsing the above table our Veteran would get a rating of 20% for their right eye with their left eye getting a 0% rating.\n\n\n", "rating": {"0%": "10%", "10%": "20%", "30%": "30%"}}, {"id": "https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/eyes/#wiki_muscle_dysfunction_and_central_visual_acuity", "area": "eyes", "title": "Muscle Dysfunction and Central Visual Acuity", "content": "\nWhen the Veteran has both muscle dysfunction and central visual acuity issues.\n\n\nGo through the following steps:\n\n\n1.
